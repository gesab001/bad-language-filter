1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye [be] a great multitude, and [there are] with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of [other] lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, [the same] may be a priest of [them that are] no gods.

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But as for us, the LORD [is] our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, [are] the sons of Aaron, and the Levites [wait] upon [their] business:

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also [set they in order] upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And, behold, God himself is with us for [our] captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

6
00:05:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment [was] behind them.

7
00:06:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle [was] before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.

8
00:07:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

9
00:08:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.

10
00:09:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.

11
00:10:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.

12
00:11:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.

13
00:12:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

14
00:13:00,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

15
00:14:00,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, [are] written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

16
00:15:00,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.

17
00:16:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And Asa did [that which was] good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:

18
00:17:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
For he took away the altars of the strange [gods,] and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

19
00:18:00,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.

20
00:19:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

21
00:20:00,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.

22
00:21:00,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about [them] walls, and towers, gates, and bars, [while] the land [is] yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought [him,] and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.

23
00:22:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And Asa had an army [of men] that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these [were] mighty men of valour.

24
00:23:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.

25
00:24:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

26
00:25:00,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, [it is] nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou [art] our God; let not man prevail against thee.

27
00:26:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.

28
00:27:00,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And Asa and the people that [were] with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

29
00:28:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

30
00:29:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

31
00:30:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

32
00:31:00,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD [is] with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

33
00:32:00,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Now for a long season Israel [hath been] without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.

34
00:33:00,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

35
00:34:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And in those times [there was] no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations [were] upon all the inhabitants of the countries.

36
00:35:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.

37
00:36:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.

38
00:37:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that [was] before the porch of the LORD.

39
00:38:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God [was] with him.

40
00:39:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

41
00:40:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil [which] they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.

42
00:41:00,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

43
00:42:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

44
00:43:00,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

45
00:44:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

46
00:45:00,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And also [concerning] Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from [being] queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped [it,] and burnt [it] at the brook Kidron.

47
00:46:00,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

48
00:47:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.

49
00:48:00,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And there was no [more] war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

50
00:49:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

51
00:50:00,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

52
00:51:00,000 --> 00:52:00,000
[There is] a league between me and thee, as [there was] between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

53
00:52:00,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

54
00:53:00,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard [it,] that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

55
00:54:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

56
00:55:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

57
00:56:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

58
00:57:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of [them] whose heart [is] perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

59
00:58:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for [he was] in a rage with him because of this [thing.] And Asa oppressed [some] of the people the same time.

60
00:59:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they [are] written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

61
01:00:00,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease [was] exceeding [great:] yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

62
01:01:00,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.

63
01:02:00,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds [of spices] prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.

64
01:03:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.

65
01:04:00,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

66
01:05:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

67
01:06:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But sought to the [LORD] God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

68
01:07:00,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.

69
01:08:00,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

70
01:09:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, [even] to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

71
01:10:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And with them [he sent] Levites, [even] Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

72
01:11:00,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And they taught in Judah, and [had] the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.

73
01:12:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that [were] round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.

74
01:13:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Also [some] of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.

75
01:14:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.

76
01:15:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, [were] in Jerusalem.

77
01:16:00,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And these [are] the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.

78
01:17:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And next to him [was] Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.

79
01:18:00,000 --> 01:19:00,000
And next him [was] Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.

80
01:19:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

81
01:20:00,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And next him [was] Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

82
01:21:00,000 --> 01:22:00,000
These waited on the king, beside [those] whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

83
01:22:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.

84
01:23:00,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And after [certain] years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that [he had] with him, and persuaded him to go up [with him] to Ramoth-gilead.

85
01:24:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I [am] as thou [art,] and my people as thy people; and [we will be] with thee in the war.

86
01:25:00,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

87
01:26:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver [it] into the king's hand.

88
01:27:00,000 --> 01:28:00,000
But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?

89
01:28:00,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

90
01:29:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And the king of Israel called for one [of his] officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

91
01:30:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in [their] robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.

92
01:31:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.

93
01:32:00,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king.

94
01:33:00,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.

95
01:34:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And Micaiah said, [As] the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.

96
01:35:00,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.

97
01:36:00,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?

98
01:37:00,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return [therefore] every man to his house in peace.

99
01:38:00,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee [that] he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

100
01:39:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and [on] his left.

101
01:40:00,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

102
01:41:00,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?

103
01:42:00,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And [the LORD] said, Thou shalt entice [him,] and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do [even] so.

104
01:43:00,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.

105
01:44:00,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

106
01:45:00,000 --> 01:46:00,000
And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

107
01:46:00,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;

108
01:47:00,000 --> 01:48:00,000
And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.

109
01:48:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, [then] hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.

110
01:49:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

111
01:50:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.

112
01:51:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that [were] with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.

113
01:52:00,000 --> 01:53:00,000
And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It [is] the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them [to depart] from him.

114
01:53:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.

115
01:54:00,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And a [certain] man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.

116
01:55:00,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed [himself] up in [his] chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

117
01:56:00,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.

118
01:57:00,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.

119
01:58:00,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.

120
01:59:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

121
02:00:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,

122
02:01:00,000 --> 02:02:00,000
And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

123
02:02:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do [it:] for [there is] no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

124
02:03:00,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and [of] the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.

125
02:04:00,000 --> 02:05:00,000
And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

126
02:05:00,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.

127
02:06:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites [shall be] officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.

128
02:07:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
It came to pass after this also, [that] the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them [other] beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

129
02:08:00,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they [be] Hazazon-tamar, which [is] En-gedi.

130
02:09:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

131
02:10:00,000 --> 02:11:00,000
And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask [help] of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.

132
02:11:00,000 --> 02:12:00,000
And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

133
02:12:00,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And said, O LORD God of our fathers, [art] not thou God in heaven? and rulest [not] thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand [is there not] power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

134
02:13:00,000 --> 02:14:00,000
[Art] not thou our God, [who] didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?

135
02:14:00,000 --> 02:15:00,000
And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,

136
02:15:00,000 --> 02:16:00,000
If, [when] evil cometh upon us, [as] the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name [is] in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

137
02:16:00,000 --> 02:17:00,000
And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;

138
02:17:00,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Behold, [I say, how] they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

139
02:18:00,000 --> 02:19:00,000
O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes [are] upon thee.

140
02:19:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

141
02:20:00,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;

142
02:21:00,000 --> 02:22:00,000
And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle [is] not yours, but God's.

143
02:22:00,000 --> 02:23:00,000
To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.

144
02:23:00,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Ye shall not [need] to fight in this [battle:] set yourselves, stand ye [still,] and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD [will be] with you.

145
02:24:00,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with [his] face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.

146
02:25:00,000 --> 02:26:00,000
And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.

147
02:26:00,000 --> 02:27:00,000
And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

148
02:27:00,000 --> 02:28:00,000
And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.

149
02:28:00,000 --> 02:29:00,000
And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

150
02:29:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy [them:] and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

151
02:30:00,000 --> 02:31:00,000
And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they [were] dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

152
02:31:00,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

153
02:32:00,000 --> 02:33:00,000
And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

154
02:33:00,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

155
02:34:00,000 --> 02:35:00,000
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

156
02:35:00,000 --> 02:36:00,000
And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of [those] countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.

157
02:36:00,000 --> 02:37:00,000
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.

158
02:37:00,000 --> 02:38:00,000
And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: [he was] thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name [was] Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

159
02:38:00,000 --> 02:39:00,000
And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing [that which was] right in the sight of the LORD.

160
02:39:00,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

161
02:40:00,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they [are] written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

162
02:41:00,000 --> 02:42:00,000
And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

163
02:42:00,000 --> 02:43:00,000
And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-gaber.

164
02:43:00,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

165
02:44:00,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

166
02:45:00,000 --> 02:46:00,000
And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these [were] the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

167
02:46:00,000 --> 02:47:00,000
And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he [was] the firstborn.

168
02:47:00,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and [divers] also of the princes of Israel.

169
02:48:00,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Jehoram [was] thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

170
02:49:00,000 --> 02:50:00,000
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought [that which was] evil in the eyes of the LORD.

171
02:50:00,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

172
02:51:00,000 --> 02:52:00,000
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.

173
02:52:00,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

174
02:53:00,000 --> 02:54:00,000
So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time [also] did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

175
02:54:00,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah [thereto.]

176
02:55:00,000 --> 02:56:00,000
And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

177
02:56:00,000 --> 02:57:00,000
But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, [which were] better than thyself:

178
02:57:00,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

179
02:58:00,000 --> 02:59:00,000
And thou [shalt have] great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
