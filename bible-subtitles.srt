1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
2 Timothy 1:5

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 1:13

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2 Timothy 2:2

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him,] we shall also live with [him: ] 
2 Timothy 2:11

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 
2 Timothy 2:13

6
00:05:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
2 Timothy 2:18

7
00:06:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2 Timothy 2:22

8
00:07:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2 Timothy 3:8

9
00:08:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
2 Timothy 3:10

10
00:09:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 3:15

11
00:10:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: 
2 Timothy 4:7

12
00:11:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
Titus 1:1

13
00:12:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
Titus 1:4

14
00:13:00,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
Titus 1:6

15
00:14:00,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
Titus 1:9

16
00:15:00,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
Titus 1:13

17
00:16:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
Titus 2:2

18
00:17:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
Titus 3:8

19
00:18:00,000 --> 00:19:00,000
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen. 
Titus 3:15

20
00:19:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
Philemon 1:5

21
00:20:00,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
Philemon 1:6

22
00:21:00,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
Hebrews 2:17

23
00:22:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house. 
Hebrews 3:2

24
00:23:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
Hebrews 3:5

25
00:24:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it. ] 
Hebrews 4:2

26
00:25:00,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
Hebrews 6:1

27
00:26:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
Hebrews 6:12

28
00:27:00,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
Hebrews 10:22

29
00:28:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
Hebrews 10:23

30
00:29:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
Hebrews 10:38

31
00:30:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
Hebrews 11:1

32
00:31:00,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 
Hebrews 11:3

33
00:32:00,000 --> 00:33:00,000
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
Hebrews 11:4

34
00:33:00,000 --> 00:34:00,000
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
Hebrews 11:5

35
00:34:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000
But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him:] for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
Hebrews 11:6

36
00:35:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. 
Hebrews 11:7

37
00:36:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
Hebrews 11:8

38
00:37:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
Hebrews 11:9

39
00:38:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
Hebrews 11:11

40
00:39:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them,] and embraced [them,] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
Hebrews 11:13

41
00:40:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son, ]

42
00:41:00,000 --> 00:42:00,000
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
Hebrews 11:20

43
00:42:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff. 
Hebrews 11:21

44
00:43:00,000 --> 00:44:00,000

Hebrews 11:22

45
00:44:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
Hebrews 11:23

46
00:45:00,000 --> 00:46:00,000
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
Hebrews 11:24

47
00:46:00,000 --> 00:47:00,000
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
Hebrews 11:27

48
00:47:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
Hebrews 11:28

49
00:48:00,000 --> 00:49:00,000
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land:] which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

50
00:49:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000

Hebrews 11:31

52
00:51:00,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
Hebrews 11:33

53
00:52:00,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
Hebrews 11:39

54
00:53:00,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
Hebrews 12:2

55
00:54:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation. 
Hebrews 13:7

56
00:55:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Knowing [this,] that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 
James 1:3

57
00:56:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
James 1:6

58
00:57:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons. 
James 2:1

59
00:58:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
James 2:5

60
00:59:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
James 2:14

61
01:00:00,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 
James 2:17

62
01:01:00,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 
James 2:18

63
01:02:00,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
James 2:20

64
01:03:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 
James 2:22

65
01:04:00,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
James 2:24

66
01:05:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. 
James 2:26

67
01:06:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 
James 5:15

68
01:07:00,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1 Peter 1:5

69
01:08:00,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
1 Peter 1:7

70
01:09:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls. 
1 Peter 1:9

71

Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
1 Peter 1:21

72
01:11:00,000 --> 01:12:00,000

1 Peter 4:19

73
01:12:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
1 Peter 5:9

74
01:13:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 
1 Peter 5:12

75
01:14:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
2 Peter 1:1

76
01:15:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
2 Peter 1:5

77
01:16:00,000 --> 01:17:00,000
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1 John 1:9

78
01:17:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, [even] our faith. 
1 John 5:4

79
01:18:00,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
3 John 1:5

80
01:19:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort [you] that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. 
Jude 1:3

81
01:20:00,000 --> 01:21:00,000
But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 
Jude 1:20

82
01:21:00,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, [and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
Revelation 1:5

83
01:22:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. 
Revelation 2:10

84
01:23:00,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is:] and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. 
Revelation 2:13

85
01:24:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000

87
01:26:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 
Revelation 13:10

88

1 Samuel 26:23

99
01:38:00,000 --> 01:39:00,000

03:30:00,000 --> 03:31:00,000
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
Romans 3:3

212
03:31:00,000 --> 03:32:00,000
Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
Romans 3:22

213
03:32:00,000 --> 03:33:00,000
Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
Romans 3:25

214
03:33:00,000 --> 03:34:00,000
Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Romans 3:27

215
03:34:00,000 --> 03:35:00,000
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
Romans 3:28

216
03:35:00,000 --> 03:36:00,000
Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
Romans 3:30

217
03:36:00,000 --> 03:37:00,000
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. 
Romans 3:31

218
03:37:00,000 --> 03:38:00,000
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
Romans 4:5

219
03:38:00,000 --> 03:39:00,000
[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only,] or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
Romans 4:9

220
03:39:00,000 --> 03:40:00,000
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
Romans 4:11

221
03:40:00,000 --> 03:41:00,000
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised. 
Romans 4:12

222
03:41:00,000 --> 03:42:00,000
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
Romans 4:13

223
03:42:00,000 --> 03:43:00,000
For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
Romans 4:14

224
03:43:00,000 --> 03:44:00,000
Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
Romans 4:16

225
03:44:00,000 --> 03:45:00,000
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
Romans 4:19

226
03:45:00,000 --> 03:46:00,000
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
Romans 4:20

227
03:46:00,000 --> 03:47:00,000
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Romans 5:1

228
03:47:00,000 --> 03:48:00,000
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
Romans 5:2

229
03:48:00,000 --> 03:49:00,000
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
Romans 9:30

230
03:49:00,000 --> 03:50:00,000
Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
Romans 9:32

231
03:50:00,000 --> 03:51:00,000
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above:]) 
Romans 10:6

232
03:51:00,000 --> 03:52:00,000
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
Romans 10:8

233
03:52:00,000 --> 03:53:00,000
So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
Romans 10:17

234
03:53:00,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
Romans 11:20

235
03:54:00,000 --> 03:55:00,000
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
Romans 12:3

236
03:55:00,000 --> 03:56:00,000
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith; 
Romans 12:6

237
03:56:00,000 --> 03:57:00,000
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations. 
Romans 14:1

238
03:57:00,000 --> 03:58:00,000
Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
Romans 14:22

239
03:58:00,000 --> 03:59:00,000
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin. 
Romans 14:23

240
03:59:00,000 --> 04:00:00,000
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
Romans 16:26

241
04:00:00,000 --> 04:01:00,000
God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Corinthians 1:9

242
04:01:00,000 --> 04:02:00,000
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
1 Corinthians 2:5

243
04:02:00,000 --> 04:03:00,000
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1 Corinthians 4:2

244
04:03:00,000 --> 04:04:00,000
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
1 Corinthians 4:17

245
04:04:00,000 --> 04:05:00,000
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1 Corinthians 7:25

246
04:05:00,000 --> 04:06:00,000
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it.] 
1 Corinthians 10:13

247
04:06:00,000 --> 04:07:00,000
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
1 Corinthians 12:9

248
04:07:00,000 --> 04:08:00,000
And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
1 Corinthians 13:2

249
04:08:00,000 --> 04:09:00,000
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity. 
1 Corinthians 13:13

250
04:09:00,000 --> 04:10:00,000
And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain. 
1 Corinthians 15:14

251
04:10:00,000 --> 04:11:00,000
And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
1 Corinthians 15:17

252
04:11:00,000 --> 04:12:00,000
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1 Corinthians 16:13

253
04:12:00,000 --> 04:13:00,000
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
2 Corinthians 1:24

254
04:13:00,000 --> 04:14:00,000
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
2 Corinthians 4:13

255
04:14:00,000 --> 04:15:00,000
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
2 Corinthians 5:7

256
04:15:00,000 --> 04:16:00,000
Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also. 
2 Corinthians 8:7

257
04:16:00,000 --> 04:17:00,000
Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is,] of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
2 Corinthians 10:15

258
04:17:00,000 --> 04:18:00,000
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
2 Corinthians 13:5

259
04:18:00,000 --> 04:19:00,000
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
Galatians 1:23

260
04:19:00,000 --> 04:20:00,000
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
Galatians 2:16

261
04:20:00,000 --> 04:21:00,000
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
Galatians 2:20

262
04:21:00,000 --> 04:22:00,000
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:2

263
04:22:00,000 --> 04:23:00,000
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:5

264
04:23:00,000 --> 04:24:00,000
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
Galatians 3:7

265
04:24:00,000 --> 04:25:00,000
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
Galatians 3:8

266
04:25:00,000 --> 04:26:00,000
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
Galatians 3:9

267
04:26:00,000 --> 04:27:00,000
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
Galatians 3:11

268
04:27:00,000 --> 04:28:00,000
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
Galatians 3:12

269
04:28:00,000 --> 04:29:00,000
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
Galatians 3:14

270
04:29:00,000 --> 04:30:00,000
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
Galatians 3:22

271
04:30:00,000 --> 04:31:00,000
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
Galatians 3:23

272
04:31:00,000 --> 04:32:00,000
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
Galatians 3:24

273
04:32:00,000 --> 04:33:00,000
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
Galatians 3:25

274
04:33:00,000 --> 04:34:00,000
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
Galatians 3:26

275
04:34:00,000 --> 04:35:00,000
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
Galatians 5:5

276
04:35:00,000 --> 04:36:00,000
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
Galatians 5:6

277
04:36:00,000 --> 04:37:00,000
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
Galatians 5:22

278
04:37:00,000 --> 04:38:00,000
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
Galatians 6:10

279
04:38:00,000 --> 04:39:00,000
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Ephesians 1:1

280
04:39:00,000 --> 04:40:00,000
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
Ephesians 1:15

281
04:40:00,000 --> 04:41:00,000
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 
Ephesians 2:8

282
04:41:00,000 --> 04:42:00,000
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
Ephesians 3:12

283
04:42:00,000 --> 04:43:00,000
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
Ephesians 3:17

284
04:43:00,000 --> 04:44:00,000
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
Ephesians 4:5

285
04:44:00,000 --> 04:45:00,000
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
Ephesians 4:13

286
04:45:00,000 --> 04:46:00,000
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
Ephesians 6:16

287
04:46:00,000 --> 04:47:00,000
But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
Ephesians 6:21

288
04:47:00,000 --> 04:48:00,000
Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ephesians 6:23

289
04:48:00,000 --> 04:49:00,000
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
Philippians 1:25

290
04:49:00,000 --> 04:50:00,000
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
Philippians 1:27

291
04:50:00,000 --> 04:51:00,000
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
Philippians 2:17

292
04:51:00,000 --> 04:52:00,000
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
Philippians 3:9

293
04:52:00,000 --> 04:53:00,000
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Colossians 1:2

294
04:53:00,000 --> 04:54:00,000
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints, 
Colossians 1:4

295
04:54:00,000 --> 04:55:00,000
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
Colossians 1:7

296
04:55:00,000 --> 04:56:00,000
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
Colossians 1:23

297
04:56:00,000 --> 04:57:00,000
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
Colossians 2:5

298
04:57:00,000 --> 04:58:00,000
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Colossians 2:7

299
04:58:00,000 --> 04:59:00,000
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
Colossians 2:12

300
04:59:00,000 --> 05:00:00,000
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 
Colossians 4:7

301
05:00:00,000 --> 05:01:00,000
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here. 
Colossians 4:9

302
05:01:00,000 --> 05:02:00,000
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
1 Thessalonians 1:3

303
05:02:00,000 --> 05:03:00,000
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
1 Thessalonians 1:8

304
05:03:00,000 --> 05:04:00,000
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:2

305
05:04:00,000 --> 05:05:00,000
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
1 Thessalonians 3:5

306
05:05:00,000 --> 05:06:00,000
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you: 
1 Thessalonians 3:6

307
05:06:00,000 --> 05:07:00,000
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:7

308
05:07:00,000 --> 05:08:00,000
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
1 Thessalonians 3:10

309
05:08:00,000 --> 05:09:00,000
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1 Thessalonians 5:8

310
05:09:00,000 --> 05:10:00,000
Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it.] 
1 Thessalonians 5:24

311
05:10:00,000 --> 05:11:00,000
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
2 Thessalonians 1:3

312
05:11:00,000 --> 05:12:00,000
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
2 Thessalonians 1:4

313
05:12:00,000 --> 05:13:00,000
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
2 Thessalonians 1:11

314
05:13:00,000 --> 05:14:00,000
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith. 
2 Thessalonians 3:2

315
05:14:00,000 --> 05:15:00,000
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil. 
2 Thessalonians 3:3

316
05:15:00,000 --> 05:16:00,000
Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Timothy 1:2

317
05:16:00,000 --> 05:17:00,000
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do. ] 
1 Timothy 1:4

318
05:17:00,000 --> 05:18:00,000
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned: 
1 Timothy 1:5

319
05:18:00,000 --> 05:19:00,000
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
1 Timothy 1:12

320
05:19:00,000 --> 05:20:00,000
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 1:14

321
05:20:00,000 --> 05:21:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
1 Timothy 1:15

322
05:21:00,000 --> 05:22:00,000
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
1 Timothy 1:19

323
05:22:00,000 --> 05:23:00,000
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
1 Timothy 2:7

324
05:23:00,000 --> 05:24:00,000
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. 
1 Timothy 2:15

325
05:24:00,000 --> 05:25:00,000
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1 Timothy 3:9

326
05:25:00,000 --> 05:26:00,000
Even so [must their] wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 
1 Timothy 3:11

327
05:26:00,000 --> 05:27:00,000
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 3:13

328
05:27:00,000 --> 05:28:00,000
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
1 Timothy 4:1

329
05:28:00,000 --> 05:29:00,000
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
1 Timothy 4:6

330
05:29:00,000 --> 05:30:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 
1 Timothy 4:9

331
05:30:00,000 --> 05:31:00,000
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
1 Timothy 4:12

332
05:31:00,000 --> 05:32:00,000
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
1 Timothy 5:8

333
05:32:00,000 --> 05:33:00,000
Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
1 Timothy 5:12

334
05:33:00,000 --> 05:34:00,000
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them,] because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. 
1 Timothy 6:2

335
05:34:00,000 --> 05:35:00,000
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
1 Timothy 6:10

336
05:35:00,000 --> 05:36:00,000
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
1 Timothy 6:11

337
05:36:00,000 --> 05:37:00,000
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 
1 Timothy 6:12

338
05:37:00,000 --> 05:38:00,000
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen. 
1 Timothy 6:21

339
05:38:00,000 --> 05:39:00,000
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
2 Timothy 1:5

340
05:39:00,000 --> 05:40:00,000
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 1:13

341
05:40:00,000 --> 05:41:00,000
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2 Timothy 2:2

342
05:41:00,000 --> 05:42:00,000
[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him,] we shall also live with [him: ] 
2 Timothy 2:11

343
05:42:00,000 --> 05:43:00,000
If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 
2 Timothy 2:13

344
05:43:00,000 --> 05:44:00,000
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
2 Timothy 2:18

345
05:44:00,000 --> 05:45:00,000
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2 Timothy 2:22

346
05:45:00,000 --> 05:46:00,000
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2 Timothy 3:8

347
05:46:00,000 --> 05:47:00,000
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
2 Timothy 3:10

348
05:47:00,000 --> 05:48:00,000
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 3:15

349
05:48:00,000 --> 05:49:00,000
I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: 
2 Timothy 4:7

350
05:49:00,000 --> 05:50:00,000
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
Titus 1:1

351
05:50:00,000 --> 05:51:00,000
To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
Titus 1:4

352
05:51:00,000 --> 05:52:00,000
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
Titus 1:6

353
05:52:00,000 --> 05:53:00,000
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
Titus 1:9

354
05:53:00,000 --> 05:54:00,000
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
Titus 1:13

355
05:54:00,000 --> 05:55:00,000
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
Titus 2:2

356
05:55:00,000 --> 05:56:00,000
[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
Titus 3:8

357
05:56:00,000 --> 05:57:00,000
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen. 
Titus 3:15

358
05:57:00,000 --> 05:58:00,000
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
Philemon 1:5

359
05:58:00,000 --> 05:59:00,000
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
Philemon 1:6

360
05:59:00,000 --> 06:00:00,000
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
Hebrews 2:17

361
06:00:00,000 --> 06:01:00,000
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house. 
Hebrews 3:2

362
06:01:00,000 --> 06:02:00,000
And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
Hebrews 3:5

363
06:02:00,000 --> 06:03:00,000
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it. ] 
Hebrews 4:2

364
06:03:00,000 --> 06:04:00,000
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
Hebrews 6:1

365
06:04:00,000 --> 06:05:00,000
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
Hebrews 6:12

366
06:05:00,000 --> 06:06:00,000
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
Hebrews 10:22

367
06:06:00,000 --> 06:07:00,000
Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
Hebrews 10:23

368
06:07:00,000 --> 06:08:00,000
Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
Hebrews 10:38

369
06:08:00,000 --> 06:09:00,000
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
Hebrews 11:1

370
06:09:00,000 --> 06:10:00,000
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 
Hebrews 11:3

371
06:10:00,000 --> 06:11:00,000
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
Hebrews 11:4

372
06:11:00,000 --> 06:12:00,000
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
Hebrews 11:5

373
06:12:00,000 --> 06:13:00,000
But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him:] for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
Hebrews 11:6

374
06:13:00,000 --> 06:14:00,000
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. 
Hebrews 11:7

375
06:14:00,000 --> 06:15:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
Hebrews 11:8

376
06:15:00,000 --> 06:16:00,000
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
Hebrews 11:9

377
06:16:00,000 --> 06:17:00,000
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
Hebrews 11:11

378
06:17:00,000 --> 06:18:00,000
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them,] and embraced [them,] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
Hebrews 11:13

379
06:18:00,000 --> 06:19:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son, ]

380
06:19:00,000 --> 06:20:00,000
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
Hebrews 11:20

381
06:20:00,000 --> 06:21:00,000
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff. 
Hebrews 11:21

382
06:21:00,000 --> 06:22:00,000

Hebrews 11:22

383
06:22:00,000 --> 06:23:00,000
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
Hebrews 11:23

384
06:23:00,000 --> 06:24:00,000
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
Hebrews 11:24

385
06:24:00,000 --> 06:25:00,000
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
Hebrews 11:27

386
06:25:00,000 --> 06:26:00,000
Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
Hebrews 11:28

387
06:26:00,000 --> 06:27:00,000
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land:] which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

388
06:27:00,000 --> 06:28:00,000

Hebrews 11:31

390
06:29:00,000 --> 06:30:00,000
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
Hebrews 11:33

391
06:30:00,000 --> 06:31:00,000
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
Hebrews 11:39

392
06:31:00,000 --> 06:32:00,000
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
Hebrews 12:2

393
06:32:00,000 --> 06:33:00,000
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation. 
Hebrews 13:7

394
06:33:00,000 --> 06:34:00,000
Knowing [this,] that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 
James 1:3

395
06:34:00,000 --> 06:35:00,000
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
James 1:6

396
06:35:00,000 --> 06:36:00,000
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons. 
James 2:1

397
06:36:00,000 --> 06:37:00,000
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
James 2:5

398
06:37:00,000 --> 06:38:00,000
What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
James 2:14

399
06:38:00,000 --> 06:39:00,000
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 
James 2:17

400
06:39:00,000 --> 06:40:00,000
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 
James 2:18

401
06:40:00,000 --> 06:41:00,000
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
James 2:20

402
06:41:00,000 --> 06:42:00,000
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 
James 2:22

403
06:42:00,000 --> 06:43:00,000
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
James 2:24

404
06:43:00,000 --> 06:44:00,000
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. 
James 2:26

405
06:44:00,000 --> 06:45:00,000
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 
James 5:15

406
06:45:00,000 --> 06:46:00,000
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
1 Peter 1:5

407
06:46:00,000 --> 06:47:00,000
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
1 Peter 1:7

408
06:47:00,000 --> 06:48:00,000
Receiving the end of your faith, [even] the salvation of [your] souls. 
1 Peter 1:9

409
06:48:00,000 --> 06:49:00,000
Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
1 Peter 1:21

410
06:49:00,000 --> 06:50:00,000
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls [to him] in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator. 
1 Peter 4:19

411
06:50:00,000 --> 06:51:00,000
Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
1 Peter 5:9

412
06:51:00,000 --> 06:52:00,000
By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 
1 Peter 5:12

413
06:52:00,000 --> 06:53:00,000
Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
2 Peter 1:1

414
06:53:00,000 --> 06:54:00,000
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
2 Peter 1:5

415
06:54:00,000 --> 06:55:00,000
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
1 John 1:9

416
06:55:00,000 --> 06:56:00,000
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, [even] our faith. 
1 John 5:4

417
06:56:00,000 --> 06:57:00,000
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
3 John 1:5

418
06:57:00,000 --> 06:58:00,000
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort [you] that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. 
Jude 1:3

419
06:58:00,000 --> 06:59:00,000
But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 
Jude 1:20

420
06:59:00,000 --> 07:00:00,000
And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, [and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, 
Revelation 1:5

421
07:00:00,000 --> 07:01:00,000
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast [some] of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. 
Revelation 2:10

422
07:01:00,000 --> 07:02:00,000
I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, [even] where Satan's seat [is:] and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas [was] my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. 
Revelation 2:13

423
07:02:00,000 --> 07:03:00,000
I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last [to be] more than the first. 
Revelation 2:19

424
07:03:00,000 --> 07:04:00,000
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; 
Revelation 3:14

425
07:04:00,000 --> 07:05:00,000
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

08:47:00,000 --> 08:48:00,000
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 
Luke 22:32

529
08:48:00,000 --> 08:49:00,000
Then saith he to Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust [it] into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. 
John 20:27

530
08:49:00,000 --> 08:50:00,000
And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 3:16

531
08:50:00,000 --> 08:51:00,000
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 
Acts (of the Apostles) 6:5

532
08:51:00,000 --> 08:52:00,000
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 6:7

533
08:52:00,000 --> 08:53:00,000
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 6:8

534
08:53:00,000 --> 08:54:00,000
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 11:24

535
08:54:00,000 --> 08:55:00,000
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 13:8

536
08:55:00,000 --> 08:56:00,000
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:9

537
08:56:00,000 --> 08:57:00,000
Confirming the souls of the disciples, [and] exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:22

538
08:57:00,000 --> 08:58:00,000
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:27

539
08:58:00,000 --> 08:59:00,000
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 15:9

540
08:59:00,000 --> 09:00:00,000
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 16:5

541
09:00:00,000 --> 09:01:00,000
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought [us,] saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide [there.] And she constrained us. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 16:15

542
09:01:00,000 --> 09:02:00,000
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 20:21

543
09:02:00,000 --> 09:03:00,000
And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 24:24

544
09:03:00,000 --> 09:04:00,000
To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 26:18

545
09:04:00,000 --> 09:05:00,000
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
Romans 1:5

546
09:05:00,000 --> 09:06:00,000
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
Romans 1:8

547
09:06:00,000 --> 09:07:00,000
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
Romans 1:12

548
09:07:00,000 --> 09:08:00,000
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 
Romans 1:17

549
09:08:00,000 --> 09:09:00,000
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
Romans 3:3

550
09:09:00,000 --> 09:10:00,000
Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
Romans 3:22

551
09:10:00,000 --> 09:11:00,000
Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
Romans 3:25

552
09:11:00,000 --> 09:12:00,000
Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Romans 3:27

553
09:12:00,000 --> 09:13:00,000
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
Romans 3:28

554
09:13:00,000 --> 09:14:00,000
Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
Romans 3:30

555
09:14:00,000 --> 09:15:00,000
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. 
Romans 3:31

556
09:15:00,000 --> 09:16:00,000
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
Romans 4:5

557
09:16:00,000 --> 09:17:00,000
[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only,] or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
Romans 4:9

558
09:17:00,000 --> 09:18:00,000
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
Romans 4:11

559
09:18:00,000 --> 09:19:00,000
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised. 
Romans 4:12

560
09:19:00,000 --> 09:20:00,000
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
Romans 4:13

561
09:20:00,000 --> 09:21:00,000
For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
Romans 4:14

562
09:21:00,000 --> 09:22:00,000
Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
Romans 4:16

563
09:22:00,000 --> 09:23:00,000
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
Romans 4:19

564
09:23:00,000 --> 09:24:00,000
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
Romans 4:20

565
09:24:00,000 --> 09:25:00,000
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Romans 5:1

566
09:25:00,000 --> 09:26:00,000
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
Romans 5:2

567
09:26:00,000 --> 09:27:00,000
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
Romans 9:30

568
09:27:00,000 --> 09:28:00,000
Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
Romans 9:32

569
09:28:00,000 --> 09:29:00,000
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above:]) 
Romans 10:6

570
09:29:00,000 --> 09:30:00,000
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
Romans 10:8

571
09:30:00,000 --> 09:31:00,000
So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
Romans 10:17

572
09:31:00,000 --> 09:32:00,000
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
Romans 11:20

573
09:32:00,000 --> 09:33:00,000
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
Romans 12:3

574
09:33:00,000 --> 09:34:00,000
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith; 
Romans 12:6

575
09:34:00,000 --> 09:35:00,000
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations. 
Romans 14:1

576
09:35:00,000 --> 09:36:00,000
Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
Romans 14:22

577
09:36:00,000 --> 09:37:00,000
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin. 
Romans 14:23

578
09:37:00,000 --> 09:38:00,000
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
Romans 16:26

579
09:38:00,000 --> 09:39:00,000
God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Corinthians 1:9

580
09:39:00,000 --> 09:40:00,000
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
1 Corinthians 2:5

581
09:40:00,000 --> 09:41:00,000
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1 Corinthians 4:2

582
09:41:00,000 --> 09:42:00,000
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
1 Corinthians 4:17

583
09:42:00,000 --> 09:43:00,000
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1 Corinthians 7:25

584
09:43:00,000 --> 09:44:00,000
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it.] 
1 Corinthians 10:13

585
09:44:00,000 --> 09:45:00,000
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
1 Corinthians 12:9

586
09:45:00,000 --> 09:46:00,000
And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
1 Corinthians 13:2

587
09:46:00,000 --> 09:47:00,000
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity. 
1 Corinthians 13:13

588
09:47:00,000 --> 09:48:00,000
And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain. 
1 Corinthians 15:14

589
09:48:00,000 --> 09:49:00,000
And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
1 Corinthians 15:17

590
09:49:00,000 --> 09:50:00,000
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1 Corinthians 16:13

591
09:50:00,000 --> 09:51:00,000
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
2 Corinthians 1:24

592
09:51:00,000 --> 09:52:00,000
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
2 Corinthians 4:13

593
09:52:00,000 --> 09:53:00,000
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
2 Corinthians 5:7

594
09:53:00,000 --> 09:54:00,000
Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also. 
2 Corinthians 8:7

595
09:54:00,000 --> 09:55:00,000
Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is,] of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
2 Corinthians 10:15

596
09:55:00,000 --> 09:56:00,000
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
2 Corinthians 13:5

597
09:56:00,000 --> 09:57:00,000
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
Galatians 1:23

598
09:57:00,000 --> 09:58:00,000
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
Galatians 2:16

599
09:58:00,000 --> 09:59:00,000
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
Galatians 2:20

600
09:59:00,000 --> 10:00:00,000
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:2

601
10:00:00,000 --> 10:01:00,000
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:5

602
10:01:00,000 --> 10:02:00,000
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
Galatians 3:7

603
10:02:00,000 --> 10:03:00,000
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
Galatians 3:8

604
10:03:00,000 --> 10:04:00,000
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
Galatians 3:9

605
10:04:00,000 --> 10:05:00,000
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
Galatians 3:11

606
10:05:00,000 --> 10:06:00,000
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
Galatians 3:12

607
10:06:00,000 --> 10:07:00,000
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
Galatians 3:14

608
10:07:00,000 --> 10:08:00,000
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
Galatians 3:22

609
10:08:00,000 --> 10:09:00,000
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
Galatians 3:23

610
10:09:00,000 --> 10:10:00,000
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
Galatians 3:24

611
10:10:00,000 --> 10:11:00,000
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
Galatians 3:25

612
10:11:00,000 --> 10:12:00,000
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
Galatians 3:26

613
10:12:00,000 --> 10:13:00,000
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
Galatians 5:5

614
10:13:00,000 --> 10:14:00,000
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
Galatians 5:6

615
10:14:00,000 --> 10:15:00,000
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
Galatians 5:22

616
10:15:00,000 --> 10:16:00,000
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
Galatians 6:10

617
10:16:00,000 --> 10:17:00,000
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Ephesians 1:1

618
10:17:00,000 --> 10:18:00,000
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
Ephesians 1:15

619
10:18:00,000 --> 10:19:00,000
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 
Ephesians 2:8

620
10:19:00,000 --> 10:20:00,000
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
Ephesians 3:12

621
10:20:00,000 --> 10:21:00,000
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
Ephesians 3:17

622
10:21:00,000 --> 10:22:00,000
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
Ephesians 4:5

623
10:22:00,000 --> 10:23:00,000
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
Ephesians 4:13

624
10:23:00,000 --> 10:24:00,000
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
Ephesians 6:16

625
10:24:00,000 --> 10:25:00,000
But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
Ephesians 6:21

626
10:25:00,000 --> 10:26:00,000
Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ephesians 6:23

627
10:26:00,000 --> 10:27:00,000
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
Philippians 1:25

628
10:27:00,000 --> 10:28:00,000
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
Philippians 1:27

629
10:28:00,000 --> 10:29:00,000
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
Philippians 2:17

630
10:29:00,000 --> 10:30:00,000
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
Philippians 3:9

631
10:30:00,000 --> 10:31:00,000
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Colossians 1:2

632
10:31:00,000 --> 10:32:00,000
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints, 
Colossians 1:4

633
10:32:00,000 --> 10:33:00,000
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
Colossians 1:7

634
10:33:00,000 --> 10:34:00,000
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
Colossians 1:23

635
10:34:00,000 --> 10:35:00,000
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
Colossians 2:5

636
10:35:00,000 --> 10:36:00,000
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Colossians 2:7

637
10:36:00,000 --> 10:37:00,000
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
Colossians 2:12

638
10:37:00,000 --> 10:38:00,000
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 
Colossians 4:7

639
10:38:00,000 --> 10:39:00,000
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here. 
Colossians 4:9

640
10:39:00,000 --> 10:40:00,000
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
1 Thessalonians 1:3

641
10:40:00,000 --> 10:41:00,000
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
1 Thessalonians 1:8

642
10:41:00,000 --> 10:42:00,000
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:2

643
10:42:00,000 --> 10:43:00,000
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
1 Thessalonians 3:5

644
10:43:00,000 --> 10:44:00,000
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you: 
1 Thessalonians 3:6

645
10:44:00,000 --> 10:45:00,000
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:7

646
10:45:00,000 --> 10:46:00,000
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
1 Thessalonians 3:10

647
10:46:00,000 --> 10:47:00,000
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1 Thessalonians 5:8

648
10:47:00,000 --> 10:48:00,000
Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it.] 
1 Thessalonians 5:24

649
10:48:00,000 --> 10:49:00,000
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
2 Thessalonians 1:3

650
10:49:00,000 --> 10:50:00,000
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
2 Thessalonians 1:4

651
10:50:00,000 --> 10:51:00,000
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
2 Thessalonians 1:11

652
10:51:00,000 --> 10:52:00,000
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith. 
2 Thessalonians 3:2

653
10:52:00,000 --> 10:53:00,000
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil. 
2 Thessalonians 3:3

654
10:53:00,000 --> 10:54:00,000
Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Timothy 1:2

655
10:54:00,000 --> 10:55:00,000
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do. ] 
1 Timothy 1:4

656
10:55:00,000 --> 10:56:00,000
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned: 
1 Timothy 1:5

657
10:56:00,000 --> 10:57:00,000
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
1 Timothy 1:12

658
10:57:00,000 --> 10:58:00,000
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 1:14

659
10:58:00,000 --> 10:59:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
1 Timothy 1:15

660
10:59:00,000 --> 11:00:00,000
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
1 Timothy 1:19

661
11:00:00,000 --> 11:01:00,000
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
1 Timothy 2:7

662
11:01:00,000 --> 11:02:00,000
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. 
1 Timothy 2:15

663
11:02:00,000 --> 11:03:00,000
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1 Timothy 3:9

664
11:03:00,000 --> 11:04:00,000
Even so [must their] wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 
1 Timothy 3:11

665
11:04:00,000 --> 11:05:00,000
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 3:13

666
11:05:00,000 --> 11:06:00,000
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
1 Timothy 4:1

667
11:06:00,000 --> 11:07:00,000
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
1 Timothy 4:6

668
11:07:00,000 --> 11:08:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 
1 Timothy 4:9

669
11:08:00,000 --> 11:09:00,000
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
1 Timothy 4:12

670
11:09:00,000 --> 11:10:00,000
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
1 Timothy 5:8

671
11:10:00,000 --> 11:11:00,000
Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
1 Timothy 5:12

672
11:11:00,000 --> 11:12:00,000
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them,] because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. 
1 Timothy 6:2

673
11:12:00,000 --> 11:13:00,000
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
1 Timothy 6:10

674
11:13:00,000 --> 11:14:00,000
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
1 Timothy 6:11

675
11:14:00,000 --> 11:15:00,000
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 
1 Timothy 6:12

676
11:15:00,000 --> 11:16:00,000
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen. 
1 Timothy 6:21

677
11:16:00,000 --> 11:17:00,000
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
2 Timothy 1:5

678
11:17:00,000 --> 11:18:00,000
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 1:13

679
11:18:00,000 --> 11:19:00,000
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2 Timothy 2:2

680
11:19:00,000 --> 11:20:00,000
[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him,] we shall also live with [him: ] 
2 Timothy 2:11

681
11:20:00,000 --> 11:21:00,000
If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 
2 Timothy 2:13

682
11:21:00,000 --> 11:22:00,000
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
2 Timothy 2:18

683
11:22:00,000 --> 11:23:00,000
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2 Timothy 2:22

684
11:23:00,000 --> 11:24:00,000
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2 Timothy 3:8

685
11:24:00,000 --> 11:25:00,000
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
2 Timothy 3:10

686
11:25:00,000 --> 11:26:00,000
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 3:15

687
11:26:00,000 --> 11:27:00,000
I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: 
2 Timothy 4:7

688
11:27:00,000 --> 11:28:00,000
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
Titus 1:1

689
11:28:00,000 --> 11:29:00,000
To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
Titus 1:4

690
11:29:00,000 --> 11:30:00,000
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
Titus 1:6

691
11:30:00,000 --> 11:31:00,000
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
Titus 1:9

692
11:31:00,000 --> 11:32:00,000
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
Titus 1:13

693
11:32:00,000 --> 11:33:00,000
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
Titus 2:2

694
11:33:00,000 --> 11:34:00,000
[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
Titus 3:8

695
11:34:00,000 --> 11:35:00,000
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen. 
Titus 3:15

696
11:35:00,000 --> 11:36:00,000
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
Philemon 1:5

697
11:36:00,000 --> 11:37:00,000
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
Philemon 1:6

698
11:37:00,000 --> 11:38:00,000
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
Hebrews 2:17

699
11:38:00,000 --> 11:39:00,000
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house. 
Hebrews 3:2

700
11:39:00,000 --> 11:40:00,000
And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
Hebrews 3:5

701
11:40:00,000 --> 11:41:00,000
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it. ] 
Hebrews 4:2

702
11:41:00,000 --> 11:42:00,000
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
Hebrews 6:1

703
11:42:00,000 --> 11:43:00,000
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
Hebrews 6:12

704
11:43:00,000 --> 11:44:00,000
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
Hebrews 10:22

705
11:44:00,000 --> 11:45:00,000
Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
Hebrews 10:23

706
11:45:00,000 --> 11:46:00,000
Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
Hebrews 10:38

707
11:46:00,000 --> 11:47:00,000
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
Hebrews 11:1

708
11:47:00,000 --> 11:48:00,000
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 
Hebrews 11:3

709
11:48:00,000 --> 11:49:00,000
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
Hebrews 11:4

710
11:49:00,000 --> 11:50:00,000
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
Hebrews 11:5

711
11:50:00,000 --> 11:51:00,000
But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him:] for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
Hebrews 11:6

712
11:51:00,000 --> 11:52:00,000
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. 
Hebrews 11:7

713
11:52:00,000 --> 11:53:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
Hebrews 11:8

714
11:53:00,000 --> 11:54:00,000
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
Hebrews 11:9

715
11:54:00,000 --> 11:55:00,000
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
Hebrews 11:11

716
11:55:00,000 --> 11:56:00,000
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them,] and embraced [them,] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
Hebrews 11:13

717
11:56:00,000 --> 11:57:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son, ] 
Hebrews 11:17

718
11:57:00,000 --> 11:58:00,000
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
Hebrews 11:20

719
11:58:00,000 --> 11:59:00,000
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff. 
Hebrews 11:21

720
11:59:00,000 --> 12:00:00,000
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones. 
Hebrews 11:22

721
12:00:00,000 --> 12:01:00,000
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
Hebrews 11:23

722
12:01:00,000 --> 12:02:00,000
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
Hebrews 11:24

723
12:02:00,000 --> 12:03:00,000
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
Hebrews 11:27

724
12:03:00,000 --> 12:04:00,000
Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
Hebrews 11:28

725
12:04:00,000 --> 12:05:00,000
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land:] which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned. 
Hebrews 11:29

726
12:05:00,000 --> 12:06:00,000
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days. 
Hebrews 11:30

727
12:06:00,000 --> 12:07:00,000
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. 
Hebrews 11:31

728
12:07:00,000 --> 12:08:00,000
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
Hebrews 11:33

729
12:08:00,000 --> 12:09:00,000
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
Hebrews 11:39

730
12:09:00,000 --> 12:10:00,000
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of [our] faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
Hebrews 12:2

731
12:10:00,000 --> 12:11:00,000
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation. 
Hebrews 13:7

732
12:11:00,000 --> 12:12:00,000
Knowing [this,] that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 
James 1:3

733
12:12:00,000 --> 12:13:00,000
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
James 1:6

734
12:13:00,000 --> 12:14:00,000
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons. 
James 2:1

735
12:14:00,000 --> 12:15:00,000
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
James 2:5

736
12:15:00,000 --> 12:16:00,000
What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
James 2:14

737
12:16:00,000 --> 12:17:00,000
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 
James 2:17

738
12:17:00,000 --> 12:18:00,000
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 
James 2:18

739
12:18:00,000 --> 12:19:00,000
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
James 2:20

740
12:19:00,000 --> 12:20:00,000
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 
James 2:22

741
12:20:00,000 --> 12:21:00,000
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

Luke 9:41

855
14:14:00,000 --> 14:15:00,000

860
14:19:00,000 --> 14:20:00,000

Acts (of the Apostles) 6:8

872
14:31:00,000 --> 14:32:00,000
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 11:24

873
14:32:00,000 --> 14:33:00,000
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 13:8

874
14:33:00,000 --> 14:34:00,000
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:9

875
14:34:00,000 --> 14:35:00,000
Confirming the souls of the disciples, [and] exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:22

876
14:35:00,000 --> 14:36:00,000
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:27

877
14:36:00,000 --> 14:37:00,000
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 15:9

878
14:37:00,000 --> 14:38:00,000

879
14:38:00,000 --> 14:39:00,000

Acts (of the Apostles) 16:15

880
14:39:00,000 --> 14:40:00,000
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 20:21

881
14:40:00,000 --> 14:41:00,000

Acts (of the Apostles) 24:24

882
14:41:00,000 --> 14:42:00,000
To open their eyes, [and] to turn [them] from darkness to light, and [from] the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 
Acts (of the Apostles) 26:18

883
14:42:00,000 --> 14:43:00,000
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
Romans 1:5

884
14:43:00,000 --> 14:44:00,000
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
Romans 1:8

885
14:44:00,000 --> 14:45:00,000
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
Romans 1:12

886
14:45:00,000 --> 14:46:00,000
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 
Romans 1:17

887
14:46:00,000 --> 14:47:00,000
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
Romans 3:3

888
14:47:00,000 --> 14:48:00,000
Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
Romans 3:22

889
14:48:00,000 --> 14:49:00,000
Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
Romans 3:25

890
14:49:00,000 --> 14:50:00,000
Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Romans 3:27

891
14:50:00,000 --> 14:51:00,000
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
Romans 3:28

892
14:51:00,000 --> 14:52:00,000
Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
Romans 3:30

893
14:52:00,000 --> 14:53:00,000
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. 
Romans 3:31

894
14:53:00,000 --> 14:54:00,000
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
Romans 4:5

895
14:54:00,000 --> 14:55:00,000
[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only,] or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
Romans 4:9

896
14:55:00,000 --> 14:56:00,000
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
Romans 4:11

897
14:56:00,000 --> 14:57:00,000
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised. 
Romans 4:12

898
14:57:00,000 --> 14:58:00,000
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
Romans 4:13

899
14:58:00,000 --> 14:59:00,000
For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
Romans 4:14

900
14:59:00,000 --> 15:00:00,000
Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
Romans 4:16

901
15:00:00,000 --> 15:01:00,000
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
Romans 4:19

902
15:01:00,000 --> 15:02:00,000
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
Romans 4:20

903
15:02:00,000 --> 15:03:00,000
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Romans 5:1

904
15:03:00,000 --> 15:04:00,000
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
Romans 5:2

905
15:04:00,000 --> 15:05:00,000
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
Romans 9:30

906
15:05:00,000 --> 15:06:00,000
Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
Romans 9:32

907
15:06:00,000 --> 15:07:00,000
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above:]) 
Romans 10:6

908
15:07:00,000 --> 15:08:00,000
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
Romans 10:8

909
15:08:00,000 --> 15:09:00,000
So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
Romans 10:17

910
15:09:00,000 --> 15:10:00,000
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
Romans 11:20

911
15:10:00,000 --> 15:11:00,000
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
Romans 12:3

912
15:11:00,000 --> 15:12:00,000
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith; 
Romans 12:6

913
15:12:00,000 --> 15:13:00,000
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations. 
Romans 14:1

914
15:13:00,000 --> 15:14:00,000
Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
Romans 14:22

915
15:14:00,000 --> 15:15:00,000
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin. 
Romans 14:23

916
15:15:00,000 --> 15:16:00,000
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
Romans 16:26

917
15:16:00,000 --> 15:17:00,000
God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Corinthians 1:9

918
15:17:00,000 --> 15:18:00,000
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
1 Corinthians 2:5

919
15:18:00,000 --> 15:19:00,000
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1 Corinthians 4:2

920
15:19:00,000 --> 15:20:00,000
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
1 Corinthians 4:17

921
15:20:00,000 --> 15:21:00,000
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1 Corinthians 7:25

922
15:21:00,000 --> 15:22:00,000
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it.] 
1 Corinthians 10:13

923
15:22:00,000 --> 15:23:00,000
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
1 Corinthians 12:9

924
15:23:00,000 --> 15:24:00,000
And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
1 Corinthians 13:2

925
15:24:00,000 --> 15:25:00,000
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity. 
1 Corinthians 13:13

926
15:25:00,000 --> 15:26:00,000
And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain. 
1 Corinthians 15:14

927
15:26:00,000 --> 15:27:00,000
And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
1 Corinthians 15:17

928
15:27:00,000 --> 15:28:00,000
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1 Corinthians 16:13

929
15:28:00,000 --> 15:29:00,000
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
2 Corinthians 1:24

930
15:29:00,000 --> 15:30:00,000
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
2 Corinthians 4:13

931
15:30:00,000 --> 15:31:00,000
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
2 Corinthians 5:7

932
15:31:00,000 --> 15:32:00,000
Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also. 
2 Corinthians 8:7

933
15:32:00,000 --> 15:33:00,000
Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is,] of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
2 Corinthians 10:15

934
15:33:00,000 --> 15:34:00,000
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
2 Corinthians 13:5

935
15:34:00,000 --> 15:35:00,000
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
Galatians 1:23

936
15:35:00,000 --> 15:36:00,000
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
Galatians 2:16

937
15:36:00,000 --> 15:37:00,000
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
Galatians 2:20

938
15:37:00,000 --> 15:38:00,000
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:2

939
15:38:00,000 --> 15:39:00,000
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:5

940
15:39:00,000 --> 15:40:00,000
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
Galatians 3:7

941
15:40:00,000 --> 15:41:00,000
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
Galatians 3:8

942
15:41:00,000 --> 15:42:00,000
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
Galatians 3:9

943
15:42:00,000 --> 15:43:00,000
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
Galatians 3:11

944
15:43:00,000 --> 15:44:00,000
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
Galatians 3:12

945
15:44:00,000 --> 15:45:00,000
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
Galatians 3:14

946
15:45:00,000 --> 15:46:00,000
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
Galatians 3:22

947
15:46:00,000 --> 15:47:00,000
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
Galatians 3:23

948
15:47:00,000 --> 15:48:00,000
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
Galatians 3:24

949
15:48:00,000 --> 15:49:00,000
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
Galatians 3:25

950
15:49:00,000 --> 15:50:00,000
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
Galatians 3:26

951
15:50:00,000 --> 15:51:00,000
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
Galatians 5:5

952
15:51:00,000 --> 15:52:00,000
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
Galatians 5:6

953
15:52:00,000 --> 15:53:00,000
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
Galatians 5:22

954
15:53:00,000 --> 15:54:00,000
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
Galatians 6:10

955
15:54:00,000 --> 15:55:00,000
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Ephesians 1:1

956
15:55:00,000 --> 15:56:00,000
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
Ephesians 1:15

957
15:56:00,000 --> 15:57:00,000
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 
Ephesians 2:8

958
15:57:00,000 --> 15:58:00,000
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
Ephesians 3:12

959
15:58:00,000 --> 15:59:00,000
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
Ephesians 3:17

960
15:59:00,000 --> 16:00:00,000
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
Ephesians 4:5

961
16:00:00,000 --> 16:01:00,000
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
Ephesians 4:13

962
16:01:00,000 --> 16:02:00,000
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
Ephesians 6:16

963
16:02:00,000 --> 16:03:00,000
But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
Ephesians 6:21

964
16:03:00,000 --> 16:04:00,000
Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ephesians 6:23

965
16:04:00,000 --> 16:05:00,000
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
Philippians 1:25

966
16:05:00,000 --> 16:06:00,000
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
Philippians 1:27

967
16:06:00,000 --> 16:07:00,000
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
Philippians 2:17

968
16:07:00,000 --> 16:08:00,000
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
Philippians 3:9

969
16:08:00,000 --> 16:09:00,000
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Colossians 1:2

970
16:09:00,000 --> 16:10:00,000
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints, 
Colossians 1:4

971
16:10:00,000 --> 16:11:00,000
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
Colossians 1:7

972
16:11:00,000 --> 16:12:00,000
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
Colossians 1:23

973
16:12:00,000 --> 16:13:00,000
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
Colossians 2:5

974
16:13:00,000 --> 16:14:00,000
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Colossians 2:7

975
16:14:00,000 --> 16:15:00,000
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
Colossians 2:12

976
16:15:00,000 --> 16:16:00,000
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 
Colossians 4:7

977
16:16:00,000 --> 16:17:00,000
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here. 
Colossians 4:9

978
16:17:00,000 --> 16:18:00,000
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
1 Thessalonians 1:3

979
16:18:00,000 --> 16:19:00,000
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
1 Thessalonians 1:8

980
16:19:00,000 --> 16:20:00,000
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:2

981
16:20:00,000 --> 16:21:00,000
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
1 Thessalonians 3:5

982
16:21:00,000 --> 16:22:00,000
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you: 
1 Thessalonians 3:6

983
16:22:00,000 --> 16:23:00,000
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:7

984
16:23:00,000 --> 16:24:00,000
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
1 Thessalonians 3:10

985
16:24:00,000 --> 16:25:00,000
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1 Thessalonians 5:8

986
16:25:00,000 --> 16:26:00,000
Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it.] 
1 Thessalonians 5:24

987
16:26:00,000 --> 16:27:00,000
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
2 Thessalonians 1:3

988
16:27:00,000 --> 16:28:00,000
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
2 Thessalonians 1:4

989
16:28:00,000 --> 16:29:00,000
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
2 Thessalonians 1:11

990
16:29:00,000 --> 16:30:00,000
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith. 
2 Thessalonians 3:2

991
16:30:00,000 --> 16:31:00,000
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil. 
2 Thessalonians 3:3

992
16:31:00,000 --> 16:32:00,000
Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Timothy 1:2

993
16:32:00,000 --> 16:33:00,000
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do. ] 
1 Timothy 1:4

994
16:33:00,000 --> 16:34:00,000
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned: 
1 Timothy 1:5

995
16:34:00,000 --> 16:35:00,000
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
1 Timothy 1:12

996
16:35:00,000 --> 16:36:00,000
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 1:14

997
16:36:00,000 --> 16:37:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
1 Timothy 1:15

998
16:37:00,000 --> 16:38:00,000
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
1 Timothy 1:19

999
16:38:00,000 --> 16:39:00,000
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
1 Timothy 2:7

1000
16:39:00,000 --> 16:40:00,000
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. 
1 Timothy 2:15

1001
16:40:00,000 --> 16:41:00,000
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1 Timothy 3:9

1002
16:41:00,000 --> 16:42:00,000
Even so [must their] wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 
1 Timothy 3:11

1003
16:42:00,000 --> 16:43:00,000
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 3:13

1004
16:43:00,000 --> 16:44:00,000
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
1 Timothy 4:1

1005
16:44:00,000 --> 16:45:00,000
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
1 Timothy 4:6

1006
16:45:00,000 --> 16:46:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 
1 Timothy 4:9

1007
16:46:00,000 --> 16:47:00,000
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
1 Timothy 4:12

1008
16:47:00,000 --> 16:48:00,000
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
1 Timothy 5:8

1009
16:48:00,000 --> 16:49:00,000
Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
1 Timothy 5:12

1010
16:49:00,000 --> 16:50:00,000
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them,] because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. 
1 Timothy 6:2

1011
16:50:00,000 --> 16:51:00,000
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
1 Timothy 6:10

1012
16:51:00,000 --> 16:52:00,000
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
1 Timothy 6:11

1013
16:52:00,000 --> 16:53:00,000
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 
1 Timothy 6:12

1014
16:53:00,000 --> 16:54:00,000
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen. 
1 Timothy 6:21

1015
16:54:00,000 --> 16:55:00,000
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
2 Timothy 1:5

1016
16:55:00,000 --> 16:56:00,000
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 1:13

1017
16:56:00,000 --> 16:57:00,000
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2 Timothy 2:2

1018
16:57:00,000 --> 16:58:00,000
[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him,] we shall also live with [him: ] 
2 Timothy 2:11

1019
16:58:00,000 --> 16:59:00,000
If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 
2 Timothy 2:13

1020
16:59:00,000 --> 17:00:00,000
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
2 Timothy 2:18

1021
17:00:00,000 --> 17:01:00,000
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2 Timothy 2:22

1022
17:01:00,000 --> 17:02:00,000
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2 Timothy 3:8

1023
17:02:00,000 --> 17:03:00,000
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
2 Timothy 3:10

1024
17:03:00,000 --> 17:04:00,000
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 3:15

1025
17:04:00,000 --> 17:05:00,000
I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: 
2 Timothy 4:7

1026
17:05:00,000 --> 17:06:00,000
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
Titus 1:1

1027
17:06:00,000 --> 17:07:00,000
To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
Titus 1:4

1028
17:07:00,000 --> 17:08:00,000
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
Titus 1:6

1029
17:08:00,000 --> 17:09:00,000
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
Titus 1:9

1030
17:09:00,000 --> 17:10:00,000
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
Titus 1:13

1031
17:10:00,000 --> 17:11:00,000
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
Titus 2:2

1032
17:11:00,000 --> 17:12:00,000
[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 
Titus 3:8

1033
17:12:00,000 --> 17:13:00,000
All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen. 
Titus 3:15

1034
17:13:00,000 --> 17:14:00,000
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
Philemon 1:5

1035
17:14:00,000 --> 17:15:00,000
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
Philemon 1:6

1036
17:15:00,000 --> 17:16:00,000
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
Hebrews 2:17

1037
17:16:00,000 --> 17:17:00,000
Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house. 
Hebrews 3:2

1038
17:17:00,000 --> 17:18:00,000
And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
Hebrews 3:5

1039
17:18:00,000 --> 17:19:00,000
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it. ] 
Hebrews 4:2

1040
17:19:00,000 --> 17:20:00,000
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
Hebrews 6:1

1041
17:20:00,000 --> 17:21:00,000
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
Hebrews 6:12

1042
17:21:00,000 --> 17:22:00,000
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
Hebrews 10:22

1043
17:22:00,000 --> 17:23:00,000
Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
Hebrews 10:23

1044
17:23:00,000 --> 17:24:00,000
Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. 
Hebrews 10:38

1045
17:24:00,000 --> 17:25:00,000
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
Hebrews 11:1

1046
17:25:00,000 --> 17:26:00,000
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. 
Hebrews 11:3

1047
17:26:00,000 --> 17:27:00,000
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
Hebrews 11:4

1048
17:27:00,000 --> 17:28:00,000
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
Hebrews 11:5

1049
17:28:00,000 --> 17:29:00,000
But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him:] for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
Hebrews 11:6

1050
17:29:00,000 --> 17:30:00,000
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. 
Hebrews 11:7

1051
17:30:00,000 --> 17:31:00,000
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
Hebrews 11:8

1052
17:31:00,000 --> 17:32:00,000
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
Hebrews 11:9

1053
17:32:00,000 --> 17:33:00,000
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
Hebrews 11:11

1054
17:33:00,000 --> 17:34:00,000
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them,] and embraced [them,] and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
Hebrews 11:13

1211

20:11:00,000 --> 20:12:00,000
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
Acts (of the Apostles) 14:9

1213
20:12:00,000 --> 20:13:00,000
Confirming the souls of the disciples, [and] exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

1218
20:17:00,000 --> 20:18:00,000
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

1219
20:18:00,000 --> 20:19:00,000

1220
20:19:00,000 --> 20:20:00,000

Acts (of the Apostles) 26:18

1221
20:20:00,000 --> 20:21:00,000
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
Romans 1:5

1222
20:21:00,000 --> 20:22:00,000
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
Romans 1:8

1223
20:22:00,000 --> 20:23:00,000
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
Romans 1:12

1224
20:23:00,000 --> 20:24:00,000
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. 
Romans 1:17

1225
20:24:00,000 --> 20:25:00,000
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? 
Romans 3:3

1226
20:25:00,000 --> 20:26:00,000
Even the righteousness of God [which is] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
Romans 3:22

1227
20:26:00,000 --> 20:27:00,000
Whom God hath set forth [to be] a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
Romans 3:25

1228
20:27:00,000 --> 20:28:00,000
Where [is] boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Romans 3:27

1229
20:28:00,000 --> 20:29:00,000
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
Romans 3:28

1230
20:29:00,000 --> 20:30:00,000
Seeing [it is] one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
Romans 3:30

1231
20:30:00,000 --> 20:31:00,000
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. 
Romans 3:31

1232
20:31:00,000 --> 20:32:00,000
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
Romans 4:5

1233
20:32:00,000 --> 20:33:00,000
[Cometh] this blessedness then upon the circumcision [only,] or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
Romans 4:9

1234
20:33:00,000 --> 20:34:00,000
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had yet] being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
Romans 4:11

1235
20:34:00,000 --> 20:35:00,000
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which [he had] being [yet] uncircumcised. 
Romans 4:12

1236
20:35:00,000 --> 20:36:00,000
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, [was] not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
Romans 4:13

1237
20:36:00,000 --> 20:37:00,000
For if they which are of the law [be] heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
Romans 4:14

1238
20:37:00,000 --> 20:38:00,000
Therefore [it is] of faith, that [it might be] by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
Romans 4:16

1239
20:38:00,000 --> 20:39:00,000
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: 
Romans 4:19

1240
20:39:00,000 --> 20:40:00,000
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
Romans 4:20

1241
20:40:00,000 --> 20:41:00,000
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Romans 5:1

1242
20:41:00,000 --> 20:42:00,000
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
Romans 5:2

1243
20:42:00,000 --> 20:43:00,000
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
Romans 9:30

1244
20:43:00,000 --> 20:44:00,000
Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
Romans 9:32

1245
20:44:00,000 --> 20:45:00,000
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down [from above:]) 
Romans 10:6

1246
20:45:00,000 --> 20:46:00,000
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, [even] in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
Romans 10:8

1247
20:46:00,000 --> 20:47:00,000
So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
Romans 10:17

1248
20:47:00,000 --> 20:48:00,000
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
Romans 11:20

1249
20:48:00,000 --> 20:49:00,000
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
Romans 12:3

1250
20:49:00,000 --> 20:50:00,000
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith; 
Romans 12:6

1251
20:50:00,000 --> 20:51:00,000
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations. 
Romans 14:1

1252
20:51:00,000 --> 20:52:00,000
Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
Romans 14:22

1253
20:52:00,000 --> 20:53:00,000
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin. 
Romans 14:23

1254
20:53:00,000 --> 20:54:00,000
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
Romans 16:26

1255
20:54:00,000 --> 20:55:00,000
God [is] faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Corinthians 1:9

1256
20:55:00,000 --> 20:56:00,000
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
1 Corinthians 2:5

1257
20:56:00,000 --> 20:57:00,000
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
1 Corinthians 4:2

1258
20:57:00,000 --> 20:58:00,000
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
1 Corinthians 4:17

1259
20:58:00,000 --> 20:59:00,000
Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
1 Corinthians 7:25

1260
20:59:00,000 --> 21:00:00,000
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it.] 
1 Corinthians 10:13

1261
21:00:00,000 --> 21:01:00,000
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
1 Corinthians 12:9

1262
21:01:00,000 --> 21:02:00,000
And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
1 Corinthians 13:2

1263
21:02:00,000 --> 21:03:00,000
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity. 
1 Corinthians 13:13

1264
21:03:00,000 --> 21:04:00,000
And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain. 
1 Corinthians 15:14

1265
21:04:00,000 --> 21:05:00,000
And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
1 Corinthians 15:17

1266
21:05:00,000 --> 21:06:00,000
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
1 Corinthians 16:13

1267
21:06:00,000 --> 21:07:00,000
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
2 Corinthians 1:24

1268
21:07:00,000 --> 21:08:00,000
We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
2 Corinthians 4:13

1269
21:08:00,000 --> 21:09:00,000
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
2 Corinthians 5:7

1270
21:09:00,000 --> 21:10:00,000
Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also. 
2 Corinthians 8:7

1271
21:10:00,000 --> 21:11:00,000
Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is,] of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
2 Corinthians 10:15

1272
21:11:00,000 --> 21:12:00,000
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
2 Corinthians 13:5

1273
21:12:00,000 --> 21:13:00,000
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
Galatians 1:23

1274
21:13:00,000 --> 21:14:00,000
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. 
Galatians 2:16

1275
21:14:00,000 --> 21:15:00,000
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
Galatians 2:20

1276
21:15:00,000 --> 21:16:00,000
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:2

1277
21:16:00,000 --> 21:17:00,000
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Galatians 3:5

1278
21:17:00,000 --> 21:18:00,000
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
Galatians 3:7

1279
21:18:00,000 --> 21:19:00,000
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all nations be blessed. 
Galatians 3:8

1280
21:19:00,000 --> 21:20:00,000
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. 
Galatians 3:9

1281
21:20:00,000 --> 21:21:00,000
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith. 
Galatians 3:11

1282
21:21:00,000 --> 21:22:00,000
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. 
Galatians 3:12

1283
21:22:00,000 --> 21:23:00,000
That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
Galatians 3:14

1284
21:23:00,000 --> 21:24:00,000
But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
Galatians 3:22

1285
21:24:00,000 --> 21:25:00,000
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
Galatians 3:23

1286
21:25:00,000 --> 21:26:00,000
Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
Galatians 3:24

1287
21:26:00,000 --> 21:27:00,000
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. 
Galatians 3:25

1288
21:27:00,000 --> 21:28:00,000
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
Galatians 3:26

1289
21:28:00,000 --> 21:29:00,000
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
Galatians 5:5

1290
21:29:00,000 --> 21:30:00,000
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
Galatians 5:6

1291
21:30:00,000 --> 21:31:00,000
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
Galatians 5:22

1292
21:31:00,000 --> 21:32:00,000
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men,] especially unto them who are of the household of faith. 
Galatians 6:10

1293
21:32:00,000 --> 21:33:00,000
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Ephesians 1:1

1294
21:33:00,000 --> 21:34:00,000
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, 
Ephesians 1:15

1295
21:34:00,000 --> 21:35:00,000
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 
Ephesians 2:8

1296
21:35:00,000 --> 21:36:00,000
In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
Ephesians 3:12

1297
21:36:00,000 --> 21:37:00,000
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
Ephesians 3:17

1298
21:37:00,000 --> 21:38:00,000
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
Ephesians 4:5

1299
21:38:00,000 --> 21:39:00,000
Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
Ephesians 4:13

1300
21:39:00,000 --> 21:40:00,000
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
Ephesians 6:16

1301
21:40:00,000 --> 21:41:00,000
But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
Ephesians 6:21

1302
21:41:00,000 --> 21:42:00,000
Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ephesians 6:23

1303
21:42:00,000 --> 21:43:00,000
And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
Philippians 1:25

1304
21:43:00,000 --> 21:44:00,000
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
Philippians 1:27

1305
21:44:00,000 --> 21:45:00,000
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 
Philippians 2:17

1306
21:45:00,000 --> 21:46:00,000
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 
Philippians 3:9

1307
21:46:00,000 --> 21:47:00,000
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Colossians 1:2

1308
21:47:00,000 --> 21:48:00,000
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints, 
Colossians 1:4

1309
21:48:00,000 --> 21:49:00,000
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
Colossians 1:7

1310
21:49:00,000 --> 21:50:00,000
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
Colossians 1:23

1311
21:50:00,000 --> 21:51:00,000
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ. 
Colossians 2:5

1312
21:51:00,000 --> 21:52:00,000
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Colossians 2:7

1313
21:52:00,000 --> 21:53:00,000
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
Colossians 2:12

1314
21:53:00,000 --> 21:54:00,000
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 
Colossians 4:7

1315
21:54:00,000 --> 21:55:00,000
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here. 
Colossians 4:9

1316
21:55:00,000 --> 21:56:00,000
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
1 Thessalonians 1:3

1317
21:56:00,000 --> 21:57:00,000
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing. 
1 Thessalonians 1:8

1318
21:57:00,000 --> 21:58:00,000
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:2

1319
21:58:00,000 --> 21:59:00,000
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
1 Thessalonians 3:5

1320
21:59:00,000 --> 22:00:00,000
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you: 
1 Thessalonians 3:6

1321
22:00:00,000 --> 22:01:00,000
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith: 
1 Thessalonians 3:7

1322
22:01:00,000 --> 22:02:00,000
Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
1 Thessalonians 3:10

1323
22:02:00,000 --> 22:03:00,000
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
1 Thessalonians 5:8

1324
22:03:00,000 --> 22:04:00,000
Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it.] 
1 Thessalonians 5:24

1325
22:04:00,000 --> 22:05:00,000
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth; 
2 Thessalonians 1:3

1326
22:05:00,000 --> 22:06:00,000
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
2 Thessalonians 1:4

1327
22:06:00,000 --> 22:07:00,000
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
2 Thessalonians 1:11

1328
22:07:00,000 --> 22:08:00,000
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith. 
2 Thessalonians 3:2

1329
22:08:00,000 --> 22:09:00,000
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil. 
2 Thessalonians 3:3

1330
22:09:00,000 --> 22:10:00,000
Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
1 Timothy 1:2

1331
22:10:00,000 --> 22:11:00,000
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do. ] 
1 Timothy 1:4

1332
22:11:00,000 --> 22:12:00,000
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned: 
1 Timothy 1:5

1333
22:12:00,000 --> 22:13:00,000
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
1 Timothy 1:12

1334
22:13:00,000 --> 22:14:00,000
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 1:14

1335
22:14:00,000 --> 22:15:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
1 Timothy 1:15

1336
22:15:00,000 --> 22:16:00,000
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
1 Timothy 1:19

1337
22:16:00,000 --> 22:17:00,000
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
1 Timothy 2:7

1338
22:17:00,000 --> 22:18:00,000
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. 
1 Timothy 2:15

1339
22:18:00,000 --> 22:19:00,000
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
1 Timothy 3:9

1340
22:19:00,000 --> 22:20:00,000
Even so [must their] wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things. 
1 Timothy 3:11

1341
22:20:00,000 --> 22:21:00,000
For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
1 Timothy 3:13

1342
22:21:00,000 --> 22:22:00,000
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
1 Timothy 4:1

1343
22:22:00,000 --> 22:23:00,000
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
1 Timothy 4:6

1344
22:23:00,000 --> 22:24:00,000
This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 
1 Timothy 4:9

1345
22:24:00,000 --> 22:25:00,000
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
1 Timothy 4:12

1346
22:25:00,000 --> 22:26:00,000
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
1 Timothy 5:8

1347
22:26:00,000 --> 22:27:00,000
Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. 
1 Timothy 5:12

1348
22:27:00,000 --> 22:28:00,000
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them,] because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. 
1 Timothy 6:2

1349
22:28:00,000 --> 22:29:00,000
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. 
1 Timothy 6:10

1350
22:29:00,000 --> 22:30:00,000
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. 
1 Timothy 6:11

1351
22:30:00,000 --> 22:31:00,000
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. 
1 Timothy 6:12

1352
22:31:00,000 --> 22:32:00,000
Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen. 
1 Timothy 6:21

1353
22:32:00,000 --> 22:33:00,000
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. 
2 Timothy 1:5

1354
22:33:00,000 --> 22:34:00,000
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 1:13

1355
22:34:00,000 --> 22:35:00,000
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
2 Timothy 2:2

1356
22:35:00,000 --> 22:36:00,000
[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him,] we shall also live with [him: ] 
2 Timothy 2:11

1357
22:36:00,000 --> 22:37:00,000
If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. 
2 Timothy 2:13

1358
22:37:00,000 --> 22:38:00,000
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
2 Timothy 2:18

1359
22:38:00,000 --> 22:39:00,000
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
2 Timothy 2:22

1360
22:39:00,000 --> 22:40:00,000
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2 Timothy 3:8

1361
22:40:00,000 --> 22:41:00,000
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
2 Timothy 3:10

1362
22:41:00,000 --> 22:42:00,000
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
2 Timothy 3:15

1363
22:42:00,000 --> 22:43:00,000
I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith: 
2 Timothy 4:7

1364
22:43:00,000 --> 22:44:00,000
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 
Titus 1:1

1365
22:44:00,000 --> 22:45:00,000
To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
Titus 1:4

Philemon 1:5

1373
22:52:00,000 --> 22:53:00,000

And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
Hebrews 11:39

1406
23:25:00,000 --> 23:26:00,000
